### Global Reach

With VPC PrivateLink, you can establish private connections to AWS services in multiple regions around the world. This allows you to build a global network infrastructure that can support your business operations in different geographical locations. By leveraging the global reach of AWS, you can ensure low-latency connectivity and deliver a seamless experience to your users no matter where they are located.

## How does VPC PrivateLink work?

VPC PrivateLink works by creating a private endpoint within your VPC that is associated with the service you want to access. This private endpoint is assigned a private IP address from the IP range of your VPC. When you make a request to the service, the traffic is routed internally within the AWS network, without traversing the public internet.

When you create a VPC endpoint for a service, AWS creates an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) for the endpoint in your VPC. This ENI serves as the entry point for traffic between your VPC and the service. The ENI is assigned a private IP address from your VPC's IP range, and it acts as a virtual network interface for the service.

By utilizing the ENI, VPC PrivateLink establishes a direct and secure connection between your VPC and the service. This connection bypasses the need for a public internet gateway or a NAT gateway, ensuring that your data remains within the AWS infrastructure and is not exposed to any external networks.

Furthermore, since the traffic between your VPC and the service is routed through the ENI and the AWS network, it benefits from the high availability and scalability of the AWS infrastructure. This means that you can rely on the robustness and scalability of AWS to handle your traffic and ensure a consistent and reliable connection to the service.

Additionally, VPC PrivateLink supports both inbound and outbound traffic, allowing you to securely access the service from within your VPC, as well as enabling the service to initiate connections to resources within your VPC. This bidirectional communication further enhances the flexibility and versatility of VPC PrivateLink.

In summary, VPC PrivateLink provides a secure and private connection between your VPC and the service by creating a private endpoint and utilizing an ENI. This connection bypasses the public internet, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of your data. With its high availability and scalability, VPC PrivateLink offers a reliable and efficient solution for accessing services within the AWS infrastructure.

## Setting up VPC PrivateLink

Setting up VPC PrivateLink involves a few steps:

### Step 1: Create a VPC Endpoint

The first step is to create a [VPC endpoint](/aws-vpc-endpoints-gateway-interface.html) for the service you want to access. You can do this using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. When creating the endpoint, you need to specify the VPC and the service you want to access. AWS will automatically assign an IP address to the endpoint from your VPC's IP range.

For example, let's say you want to create a VPC endpoint to access an Amazon S3 bucket. You would go to the AWS Management Console, navigate to the VPC service, and select "Endpoints". From there, you can create a new VPC endpoint and choose "Amazon S3" as the service. You would then select the VPC in which you want to create the endpoint and click "Create Endpoint". AWS will assign an IP address to the endpoint and associate it with the selected VPC.

### Step 2: Update Route Tables

After creating the VPC endpoint, you need to update the [route tables](/aws-route-tables-for-beginners.html) in your VPC to route traffic to the endpoint. You can do this by adding a route to the route table that points to the VPC endpoint. This ensures that traffic destined for the service is directed to the endpoint instead of going through a NAT gateway or internet gateway.

To update the route tables, you would go to the AWS Management Console, navigate to the VPC service, and select "Route Tables". From there, you can select the route table associated with your VPC and add a new route. You would specify the destination IP range as the IP range of the service you want to access and set the target as the VPC endpoint you created in the previous step.

However there is a catch. How do you know the ip address range for particular aws service? The solution is to use AWS-managed prefix lists. These lists contain the IP prefixes for specific AWS services in a particular region. For example, if you're connecting to Amazon S3 privately, the prefix list would be named `pl-xxxxxx` (where xxxxxx is a unique identifier). You can then add a route to your route table that targets the prefix list instead of a specific IP range. This ensures your traffic reaches the service even if the underlying IP addresses change.

### Step 3: Configure Security Groups

Next, you need to configure the [security groups](/aws-security-groups-vs-nacls-control-traffic.html) for the service and the endpoint. By configuring the security groups, you can restrict access to the service and ensure that only authorized traffic is allowed.

To configure the security groups, you would go to the AWS Management Console, navigate to the VPC service, and select "Security Groups". From there, you can create a new security group or modify an existing one. You would specify the inbound and outbound rules to allow traffic to and from the service and the endpoint. For example, you might allow inbound traffic from specific IP addresses or subnets and allow outbound traffic to specific IP addresses or subnets.

### Step 4: Test the Connection

Once you have set up the VPC endpoint, updated the route tables, and configured the security groups, you can test the connection to the service. You can do this by making a request to the service from an instance within your VPC. If the connection is successful, you should be able to access the service without going through the public internet.

For example, if you created a VPC endpoint to access an Amazon S3 bucket, you could launch an EC2 instance within your VPC and use the AWS CLI to interact with the bucket. You would run a command like "aws s3 ls" to list the contents of the bucket. If the command returns the expected results, it means that the connection to the S3 bucket through the VPC endpoint is working correctly.

## Use Cases

### Connecting to Amazon RDS

Another use case for VPC PrivateLink is connecting to Amazon RDS, a managed relational database service. With VPC PrivateLink, you can securely access your Amazon RDS instances from your VPC without the need for public IP addresses or NAT gateways. This ensures that your database traffic remains within your VPC and is not exposed to the public internet. By using VPC PrivateLink, you can build applications that require direct and secure access to your Amazon RDS databases, such as web applications that need to retrieve or store data in a relational database.

### Accessing AWS Elastic Load Balancer

VPC PrivateLink can also be used to access AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) services from your VPC. By using VPC PrivateLink, you can securely connect to ELB without the need for public IP addresses or NAT gateways. This allows you to build scalable and highly available applications that require load balancing capabilities. With VPC PrivateLink, your application traffic can be routed directly to the ELB without traversing the public internet, ensuring that your application remains secure and performs optimally.

### Connecting to Amazon Redshift
