These policies specify what actions users or services can perform on S3 buckets and their contents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In S3, permissions are granted using ARNs (Amazon Resource Names) that identify specific resources. There are two key types of ARNs when dealing with S3 permissions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;code>arn:aws:s3:::mybucket&lt;/code> :&lt;/strong> This refers to the bucket.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>&lt;code>arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*&lt;/code> :&lt;/strong> This refers to all the objects (files) within the bucket.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>AWS developers have implemented a clear separation between permissions that apply to the bucket and permissions that apply to the objects (files) inside the bucket. This distinction is important for managing access to both the list of files and the content itself.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AWS Auto Scaling Group: EC2 and ELB Health Checks Explained</title><link>https://csetutorials.com/aws-asg-ec2-elb-health-checks.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Oct 2024 13:40:02 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://csetutorials.com/aws-asg-ec2-elb-health-checks.html</guid><description>&lt;p>When managing your application’s infrastructure on AWS, &lt;strong>Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs)&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs)&lt;/strong> work together to ensure high availability and scalability.
