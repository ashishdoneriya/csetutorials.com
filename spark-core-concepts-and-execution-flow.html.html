<a class=text-decoration-none href=/topics/big-data rel=category>Big Data</a></div><div class=post-content><p>Apache Spark is a computing system used for processing very large amounts of data quickly by distributing the work across a cluster of many computers.</p><h2 id=1-fundamental-concepts>1. Fundamental Concepts</h2><h3 id=the-distributed-dataset-and-partitions>The Distributed Dataset and Partitions</h3><p>Spark is designed to process datasets that are too large for one machine. To do this, it must divide the large dataset into smaller chunks that can be processed in parallel. Each of these chunks is called a Partition.</p><p>A partition is simply a collection of rows from the original dataset. When Spark reads a large file, it determines how to split it into multiple partitions. For example, by default, Spark often creates one partition for every 128 MB block of the file in the underlying storage system. The key idea is that a partition is the smallest piece of the dataset that a single Spark task will work on.</p><h3 id=the-task>The Task</h3><p>A Task is the smallest unit of execution in Spark. It is a single command sent from the Spark Driver to an Executor. This command contains two key components:</p><ol><li>One specific Partition of data that the task is assigned to process.</li><li>A sequence of computations (your code) that the task must apply to every record within that partition.</li></ol><p>This relationship is fundamental: to process the data in parallel, Spark creates one task for every partition.</p><h2 id=2-spark-application-architecture>2. Spark Application Architecture</h2><p>A Spark application is composed of a few key processes that work together.</p><h3 id=spark-driver-the-master-process>Spark Driver (The Master Process)</h3><p>The Driver is the central coordinator and the &ldquo;brain&rdquo; of a Spark application. It is the process where your main() function runs. Its responsibilities are:</p><ul><li>To analyze the user&rsquo;s code.</li><li>To create an optimized execution plan, known as a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).</li><li>To break the DAG into a sequence of Stages.</li><li>To break each Stage into individual Tasks.</li><li>To request resources for workers from the Cluster Manager.</li><li>To schedule and send tasks to the workers (Executors).</li><li>To track the status of all tasks and collect the final result of the job.</li></ul><h3 id=spark-executor-the-worker-process>Spark Executor (The Worker Process)</h3><p>An Executor is a process launched on a machine in the cluster. Its sole purpose is to execute the tasks assigned to it by the Driver.</p><ul><li>Each Executor has a fixed allocation of CPU cores and memory.</li><li>It runs the computations on its assigned data partition and stores any intermediate or final results.</li></ul><p>It is important to note that the Executor itself is the JVM process. A Task is not a separate process; it is a thread of execution that runs inside the Executor&rsquo;s JVM. This allows a single Executor to run multiple tasks concurrently, one on each of its allocated CPU cores.</p><h3 id=cluster-manager-the-resource-manager>Cluster Manager (The Resource Manager)</h3><p>Spark does not manage the cluster hardware itself. It relies on a Cluster Manager to request and release resources for its Executors. In the context of CDE, the Cluster Manager is Kubernetes.</p><h2 id=3-the-execution-flow>3. The Execution Flow</h2><p>This is the logical sequence of how Spark plans and runs a job.</p><h3 id=job-stage-and-task-relationship>Job, Stage, and Task Relationship</h3><ol><li><strong>Job:</strong> A Job is triggered when you call an action (e.g., <code>.count()</code>, <code>.save()</code>) in your code. This kicks off the entire computation.</li><li><strong>Stage:</strong> The Driver analyzes the job&rsquo;s plan (the DAG) and divides it into Stages. A Stage is a collection of tasks that can be run in parallel without requiring a full data exchange between all executors.</li><li><strong>Shuffle:</strong> The boundary between two stages is called a Shuffle. A shuffle is the physical redistribution of data across all executors. A new stage is created whenever a shuffle is necessary (e.g., for a <code>.groupByKey()</code> or <code>.join()</code> operation). The shuffle happens between stages.</li><li><strong>Task:</strong> The Driver breaks each Stage into Tasks. As defined before, one task is created for each partition of data that the stage needs to process.</li></ol><h3 id=how-the-number-of-executors-is-determined>How the Number of Executors is Determined</h3><p>If you do not manually specify a fixed number of executors (<code>spark.executor.instances</code>), Spark uses Dynamic Allocation.</p><ul><li>The Driver monitors the number of pending tasks.</li><li>If tasks are waiting, the Driver requests new Executor processes from the Cluster Manager (Kubernetes) to handle the load, up to a configured maximum.</li></ul><p>If an Executor is idle for a certain period, the Driver releases it, and its resources are returned to the cluster.</p><h2 id=4-execution-in-a-cdekubernetes-environment>4. Execution in a CDE/Kubernetes Environment</h2><p>In CDE, the Spark components are run as containerized processes managed by Kubernetes. The flow begins with a client process that exists outside the cluster.</p><ul><li><strong>Submitter:</strong> The process begins with a Submitter client. This is the spark-submit command or API call that you execute. Its only job is to communicate with the Kubernetes API to request the creation of the Driver Pod. Once the Driver is successfully requested, the Submitter&rsquo;s role is complete, and it can exit.</li><li><strong>Driver Pod:</strong> When a job starts, Kubernetes creates a dedicated Pod (an isolated container) to run the Spark Driver process.</li><li><strong>Executor Pods:</strong> The Driver then requests resources from Kubernetes, which in turn creates a separate Pod for each Spark Executor.</li><li><strong>Execution:</strong> The Driver Pod sends tasks to the Executor Pods. The job runs within this temporary collection of Pods.</li><li><strong>Cleanup:</strong> When the job finishes, the Driver process exits. Kubernetes detects this and destroys all Pods associated with the job (both the Driver and all Executors), immediately freeing up all cluster resources.</li></ul></div></article></main><script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js defer></script></body></html>
