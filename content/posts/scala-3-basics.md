## Scala Basics
### How to declare a variable
#### Declare a constant variable
```scala
val x: Int = 42
```
or

```scala
val x = 42
```
  
* types are optional
* val cannot be reassigned, val are constant/immutable
* Semicolon are not necessary

#### Declare a variable
```scala
var x: Int = 42
```
or

```scala
var x = 42
```
#### Expressions & Instructions
* Changing a variable is called as side effects
* Instructions are doing something.
* Expression is something that has a value.
* Donot write loops in Scala. Everything in Scala is an expression.
* There is a special data type in Scala that is `Unit`. Unit is something like inline function. eg `val x = while(i<10){println(i);i++}`
* Instructions are executed (Java). Expressions are evaluated (Scala).
#### Code Blocks
```scala
val codeBlock = {
    val z = 2;
    val w = z + 3;
    if (w > 3) "hello" else "goodbye"
}
```
* Code block is an expression.
* The value of the whole block is the value of its last expression.

### Functions
#### How  to define functions
```scala
def aFunction(a: String, b: Int): String = {
    a + " " + b
}
def aFunction1(a: String, b: Int): String = a + " " + b
def aFunction2(a: String, b: Int): String = {
   if (b == 1) a
   else a + aFunction2(a, b - 1) 
}
```
* An expression or a code block.
* Parameterless functions can be called just by their names (ie. without using parenthesis ())
* In Scala when you need loops, use recursions. This is a fundamental idea of functional programming.
* The compiler can infer the return type of a function, but we cannot figure out the return type of a recursive function. As best practice always specify the return type.
* You can also return Unit.
#### Interpolators
```scala
def play(name: String, age: Int) = println(s"Hi my name is $name and my age is $age")
def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
	play("Ashish", 31)
}
```
#### Tail Recursion (@tailrec)
Write recursion in the last expression. The idea used by compilers to optimize tail-recursive functions is simple, since the recursive call is the last statement, there is nothing left to do in the current function, so saving the current functionâ€™s stack frame is of no use.
```scala
object Playground {
	def concat(str: String, n: Int): String = {
		@tailrec
		def concat(str: String, word: String, n: Int): String = {
			if (n == 1) str
			else concat(str + word, word, n - 1);
		}
		concat(str, str, n);
	}
	def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
		println(concat("Ashish", 5))
	}
}
```
#### Call by name and call by value
* In call by value, the expression is computed before passed to the function.
* In call by name, the expression is passed as it is and is calculated every time it is being used.
* Call by name can be used for lazy evaluations.
```scala
object Playground {
	def callByValue(n: Long) = {println(n);println(n)}
	def callByName(n: => Long) = {println(n);println(n)}
	def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
		callByValue(System.nanoTime())
		/* Output -
			10957615477957
			10957615477957
		*/
		callByName(System.nanoTime())
		/* Output -
			10957771851376
			10957771908322
		*/
	}
}
```
#### Default Parameters
Scala allows us to specify default value of a parameter. This is helpful in case of accumulators (tail recursion).
```scala
def fact(n: Int, acc: Int = 1): Int
```
##### Named Parameter
```scala
def fact(n: Int, acc: Int = 1): Int
fact(acc = 12, n = 10);
```

## Object Oriented
### Obect Oriented Basic
* [Scala Constructors](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scala-constructors/)
### Syntactic Sugar: Method Notations
* In Scala All operators are methods
* In Scala every unary operators are methods
* Functions which doesn't have any parameter can be used as postfix unary operators.
* There is a special method called as `apply()`

```scala
import scala.language.postfixOps

class Person {
	//prefix
	def unary_! = "This is a string"
	//postfix
	def isAlive: Boolean = true
	//directly calling object()
	def apply(): String = "Hi buddy"
}

@main
def main(): Unit = {
	val marry = new Person
	//prefix
	println(!marry)
	//postfix
	println(marry isAlive)
	//effect of apply method
	println(marry())
}
```
```scala
import scala.language.postfixOps

class Person(val name: String, var age: Int = 0) {
	def unary_! = "This is a string"
	def +(postfix: String): Person = new Person(s"${this.name} is a ${postfix}")
	def ++ = age = age + 1;
	def learns(str:String):String = s"${this.name} learns ${str}"
	def apply(num: Int): String = s"${this.name} watched inception ${num} times"
}

@main
def main(): Unit = {
	val ashish = new Person("Ashish")
	ashish++;
	println(ashish.age)
	println(ashish learns "Scala")
	println(ashish(2))
}
```
### Scala Objects
* Scala doesn't have the concept of `static` (class level functionality). The alternative is declare as object
* Scala object is like a singleton instance
	```scala
	object Person {
		var totalPerson: Integer
	}
	```
* Scala Applications are either declared using main or by extending App
	```scala
	object Person extends App {
		var counter: Integer = 0
		val ashish = new Person("Ashish")
		println(ashish.age)
		println(ashish learns "Scala")
		println(ashish(2))
	}
	@main
	def main(): Unit = {
		val ashish = new Person("Ashish")
		println(ashish.age)
		println(ashish learns "Scala")
		println(ashish(2))
	}
	```
### Overriding & Inheritence
* Use keyword `override`
* Using `sealed` keyword in class definition, we can allow a class to get extended in the same file only.

### Abstract classes vs traits
* Abstract classes can have both abstract and non abstract methods
* A trait is like an interface with a partial implementation. In scala, trait is a collection of abstract and non-abstract methods. You can create trait that can have all abstract methods or some abstract and some non-abstract methods.
* Traits donot have constructor parameters
* Traits can be extended using `with`
* Can extend only one abstract class but we can extend multiple traits

### Generics
* In Scala generics are defined using [T]   ie. square brackets
