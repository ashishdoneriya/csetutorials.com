AWS Transit Gateway provides a centralized solution for managing network connectivity across multiple VPCs and on-premises networks. With traditional networking models, connecting multiple VPCs and on-premises networks can be a complex and time-consuming process. However, with the introduction of AWS Transit Gateway, managing network infrastructure has become much simpler and more efficient. If you want to know more about transit gateway then you can read our [previous article](/aws-transit-gateway-benefits-security-cost-optimization.html). Now lets understand various components of transit gateway first.

## Transit Gateway Resource

The Transit Gateway resource is the central component of AWS Transit Gateway. It is a highly available and scalable service that allows you to connect VPCs and on-premises networks through a single gateway. The Transit Gateway resource acts as a hub for routing traffic between different networks, making it easier to manage and control network traffic.

With the Transit Gateway resource, you can have up to 5,000 VPC attachments, which means you can connect up to 5,000 VPCs to a single Transit Gateway. This makes it ideal for large-scale deployments where you need to connect multiple VPCs across different regions or accounts.

One of the key benefits of the Transit Gateway resource is its ability to simplify network architecture. Instead of having to create and manage multiple VPN connections or use complex peering configurations, you can simply attach your VPCs to the Transit Gateway. This allows you to centralize your network connectivity and reduce the complexity of your overall network design.

Another advantage of the Transit Gateway resource is its scalability. As your organization grows and you need to connect more VPCs, you can easily scale up by adding additional attachments to the Transit Gateway. This flexibility allows you to adapt to changing business needs without the need for significant reconfiguration or downtime.

In addition to connecting VPCs, the Transit Gateway resource also provides connectivity to on-premises networks. By establishing a VPN connection between your on-premises network and the Transit Gateway, you can extend your network into the AWS cloud. This enables you to securely access resources in the cloud from your on-premises environment and vice versa.

Furthermore, the Transit Gateway resource offers advanced routing capabilities. It supports both static and dynamic routing, allowing you to choose the routing strategy that best suits your needs. You can configure static routes to define how traffic should be routed between different networks, or you can use dynamic routing protocols such as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to automatically exchange routing information with other routers.

Overall, the Transit Gateway resource provides a centralized and scalable solution for connecting VPCs and on-premises networks. Its simplicity, scalability, and advanced routing capabilities make it an essential component for organizations looking to build robust and efficient network architectures in the AWS cloud.

## VPC Attachments

VPC attachments are the connections between VPCs and the Transit Gateway. When you create a VPC attachment, you specify the VPC that you want to connect to the Transit Gateway. Once the attachment is created, the VPC becomes part of the Transit Gateway's routing domain, allowing traffic to flow between the VPC and other connected networks.

Each VPC attachment has a unique identifier, and you can associate multiple VPCs with a single Transit Gateway. This allows you to create a centralized network infrastructure where VPCs can communicate with each other and with on-premises networks.

By establishing VPC attachments, you can easily extend your network connectivity and create a hybrid architecture that combines the benefits of both cloud and on-premises environments. This enables seamless communication between your VPCs and your existing infrastructure, allowing you to leverage the scalability and flexibility of the cloud while still maintaining connectivity to your on-premises resources.

Furthermore, VPC attachments provide a secure and isolated environment for your VPCs. The Transit Gateway acts as a hub, allowing you to control traffic flow between your VPCs and other attached networks. This ensures that your data remains protected and that you can enforce security policies across your entire network infrastructure.

In addition, the ability to associate multiple VPCs with a single Transit Gateway simplifies network management. Instead of managing separate connections for each VPC, you can centralize your network configuration and routing policies. This reduces complexity and makes it easier to scale your network as your business grows.

Overall, VPC attachments play a crucial role in building a robust and flexible network architecture in the cloud. They enable seamless connectivity between VPCs and other networks, provide a secure environment, and simplify network management. With VPC attachments, you can create a scalable and efficient network infrastructure that meets the needs of your organization.

## Route Tables

Route tables play a crucial role in routing traffic within AWS Transit Gateway. Each Transit Gateway has its own set of route tables that control how traffic is routed between different networks. When you create a VPC attachment, you can associate it with one or more route tables.

Route tables contain rules that determine the path traffic takes between networks. For example, you can create a rule that directs traffic from a specific VPC to an on-premises network, or you can create a rule that allows traffic between two VPCs. By configuring the route tables, you have fine-grained control over how traffic flows within your network infrastructure.

When creating a route table, you have the option to define both inbound and outbound rules. Inbound rules control the incoming traffic to a network, while outbound rules determine the outgoing traffic. This allows you to specify the exact sources and destinations for traffic, ensuring that only authorized connections are allowed.

Route tables also support the concept of route priorities. Each route in a table is assigned a priority value, and the route with the highest priority is chosen when multiple routes match a destination. This allows you to create fallback routes or prioritize certain paths over others.

In addition to static routes, route tables can also be configured to support dynamic routing protocols such as Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). BGP enables the exchange of routing information between different networks, allowing for automatic route updates and improved network scalability.

Furthermore, route tables can be associated with multiple VPC attachments, allowing you to create complex network topologies. For example, you can configure a route table to direct traffic from one VPC to another VPC, while also allowing traffic to flow to an on-premises network. This flexibility enables you to design highly resilient and interconnected network architectures.

Overall, route tables are a fundamental component of AWS Transit Gateway, providing the necessary control and flexibility to manage traffic routing within your network infrastructure. By configuring route tables with the appropriate rules and priorities, you can ensure efficient and secure communication between different networks in your AWS environment.

## Route Propagation

Imagine you live in a giant apartment building with lots of hallways and doors. Your apartment is like your computer, and the hallways are like the internet. To get to your friends' apartments (other computers), you need to know which hallways to take.

Normally, you have a map (routing table) that shows you the way. But what if your building keeps adding new hallways and doors? With route propagation, it's like having a super helpful building manager. Whenever a new hallway is built, the manager automatically updates your map with the new way to get there.

Route propagation is a feature of AWS Transit Gateway that allows you to automatically propagate routes between different networks. When you enable route propagation, the Transit Gateway automatically advertises the routes from one network to another, making it easier to manage and control traffic.

For example, if you have a VPC attachment that is connected to an on-premises network, you can enable route propagation to automatically advertise the routes from the on-premises network to the VPC. This ensures that traffic can flow seamlessly between the two networks without the need for manual configuration.

Route propagation works by exchanging route information between the Transit Gateway and the connected networks. When a new route is added or an existing route is modified in one network, the Transit Gateway propagates the change to all the other connected networks. This eliminates the need for manual route configuration and ensures that all networks have up-to-date route information.

Route propagation is particularly useful in complex network environments where there are multiple networks that need to communicate with each other. By enabling route propagation, you can simplify the management of routes and ensure that traffic is efficiently routed between networks.

In addition to propagating routes between networks, the Transit Gateway also supports route filtering. This allows you to control which routes are propagated to specific networks. For example, you can configure the Transit Gateway to only propagate certain routes to a VPC attachment, while filtering out other routes.

Route propagation can be configured using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDKs. You can enable route propagation for each attachment associated with the Transit Gateway, allowing you to customize the route propagation settings for each network.

Overall, route propagation is a powerful feature of AWS Transit Gateway that simplifies the management of routes in complex network environments. By automatically propagating routes between networks, you can ensure that traffic flows seamlessly and efficiently between different parts of your network infrastructure.

## Transit Gateway Associations

Transit Gateway associations are the connections between Transit Gateways and other resources, such as Direct Connect gateways or VPN connections. These associations allow you to extend your network connectivity beyond the VPCs and on-premises networks connected to the Transit Gateway.

For example, if you have a Direct Connect gateway that is connected to your on-premises network, you can create an association between the Direct Connect gateway and the Transit Gateway. This allows you to route traffic between the on-premises network and the VPCs connected to the Transit Gateway.

Transit Gateway associations provide a flexible and scalable solution for connecting multiple VPCs and on-premises networks. By establishing these associations, you can create a centralized hub for network connectivity, simplifying the management and configuration of your network infrastructure.

Once the association is established, traffic can flow seamlessly between the connected resources. This means that you can easily extend your on-premises network to the cloud, allowing for seamless communication between your local resources and the resources hosted in the cloud.

In addition to connecting VPCs and on-premises networks, Transit Gateway associations also support connections to other AWS services. This means that you can easily integrate your Transit Gateway with services such as AWS Direct Connect, AWS Site-to-Site VPN, and AWS Transit Gateway Network Manager.

By leveraging Transit Gateway associations, you can achieve a highly available and scalable network architecture. The associations can be established and managed through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs, providing you with the flexibility to choose the method that best suits your needs.

Overall, Transit Gateway associations play a crucial role in extending your network connectivity and enabling seamless communication between various resources. Whether you need to connect multiple VPCs, integrate with on-premises networks, or leverage other AWS services, Transit Gateway associations provide the foundation for building a robust and scalable network infrastructure.
