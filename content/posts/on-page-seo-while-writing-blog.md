## Keyword
* Use in **Starting and Ending Para** of Content
* Place your main keyword within the first 100 words.
* Use in **Image Name, Alt Tag** and **Title Tag**
* **Title** Of Our Posts
* **Permalink** of Posts
* Keywords in **Heading Tags h1, h2…**
* **Bold** and *Italics* your keyword and other important Semantics keyword.
* Use it in **Meta Description**.
* Use **long tail keywords** in place of generic keywords.
* Instead of keyword, use **keyword phrases**. Ex:- a single word (i.e. "dating") is a keyword, but a phrase (i.e. "dating tips") is a keyword phrase.
* Place Important Keywords Close to the Front of the Title Tag
* Post Categories :- Named them correctly and put your really targeted words there.
* Post Comments :- Whenever you reply your reader’s comment on your blog, try to add some keyword phrases in your reply in a natural way that looks obvious while reading.
* **Use LSI** :- LSI is an indexing and retrieval method that uses a mathematical technique called singular value decomposition (SVD) to identify patterns in the relationships between the terms and concepts contained in an unstructured collection of text. For example, if we’re trying to rank for "common mistakes using keywords in your blog," we can also say things like "common mistakes using keywords in blogs" and "common mistakes people make using keywords in blogs. Write like a human, not a spammy robot.
* Use **keyword variations** (ex. search engine optimisation, seo, search engine ranking)
* Write **more blog posts** about the super competitive keywords.


## Title
* Make it **attractive** and **catchy**
* **Include narrower and more targeted keywords** than broad keywords. **For example:** If you have an article about "best plagiarism checker tools" go for "best plagiarism checker tools" rather than a broad "plagiarism checker" only.
* Use Multiple Keywords in Title (Ex. Role of Social Media in SEO & Importance)
* Try using **actionable and psychological keywords** on your blog post title. You can significantly boost your ranking using keywords like "updated", "step by step guide" etc. Though these words themselves have nothing to do with SERPs but they will increase your click through rate which is also a ranking factor.
* Place Important Keywords Close to the Front of the Title Tag
* **Show different post titles to readers and search engines**. ex :- User friendly title - "Make money online with infolinks", search engine friendly title - "infolink in text advertising program review".


## Meta Description
* Write a Good Meta Description with Keywords
* Add Unique meta description to make your post search engine friendly.


## Title Tag
* Keep your title tags within **59 characters**.
* Use brand name at the end of a title tag.


## URL
* Should be of 100 characters of length
* Words separated by **hyphens or dashes**
* Keep your permalink free from **stop words**


## Paragraph
* Write in Short Paragraphs :- Write your blog posts in short paragraphs (**no more than 2-3 sentences** is a safe rule) to provide visual relief from a text heavy web page. 
* Insert an image between paragraphs.


## Blog Post
* Don’t just list links. Instead, give readers a reason to stay on your blog by providing links with your own synopsis and point of view about the content of those links. Remember, a link without context is a simple way to lose readers rather than retain them.         
* Make blog post **scannable**.
* Ask Question in between the post or at the end of the post


## Links
* Link Internally
* Consider Link Placement :- Internal links should be used in the first third of your post with external links used later
* Keyword Linking :- Avoid linking the same keyword or keyword phrase to multiple URLs. Similarly, avoid linking variations of the same keyword phrase to the same URL.
* Limit the Number of Links :- one link per 125 words. 
* LSI can be used in anchor text while interlinking to a particular post.


## Images
* Name image files used in your blog posts with useful titles that explain what the images are.
* If you can include keywords in image file names naturally, do so.
* Add text for the image Alt-Tag and description.
* Use **iframe** tag for displaying images from another site. I this way the search engines recognize an iframe or a frame used to pull in another site’s content for what it is, and therefore ignore the content inside the iframe or frame as it is content published by another publisher.In other words, they don’t consider content pulled in from another site as part of the unique content of your web page.


## High Quality Content
* Are you able to offer research that is relevant or can you provide practical advice?
* Have you made any necessary corrections with regard to your facts, grammar and spelling?
* Would a machine or a reader be interested in the topic?
* Has the article been edited well?
* Is your website authoritative?
* Would you save your article for later reference?
* Are there too many promotions, advertisements or calls-to-action in the article that serve as distractions?
* Would a reputable journal or magazine be interested in printing your article?
* Is your article brief, ineffective and pointless?
* Know your visitors
* Write in simple words
* Personal touch
* Your views
