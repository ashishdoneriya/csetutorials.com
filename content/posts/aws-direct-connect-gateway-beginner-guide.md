## Pricing for AWS Direct Connect Gateway

The pricing for AWS Direct Connect Gateway depends on several factors, including the data transfer volume, the AWS region, and the type of connection you choose. Here are some key points to consider:

### Data Transfer Pricing

AWS charges for data transfer over the Direct Connect Gateway based on the data transfer volume. The pricing varies depending on whether the data transfer is within the same AWS region or across different regions. For data transfer within the same region, AWS offers a tiered pricing model where the cost per GB decreases as the volume of data transferred increases. On the other hand, for data transfer across different regions, AWS charges a higher rate per GB due to the additional network infrastructure required to facilitate the transfer.

### Direct Connect Pricing

In addition to the data transfer pricing, you also need to consider the cost of the Direct Connect connection itself. AWS offers different pricing options based on the type of connection, such as dedicated connections or hosted connections through AWS Direct Connect Partners. Dedicated connections provide a private network connection between your on-premises infrastructure and your AWS resources, ensuring low-latency and high-bandwidth connectivity. The pricing for dedicated connections is based on the port speed, ranging from 1 Gbps to 100 Gbps.
