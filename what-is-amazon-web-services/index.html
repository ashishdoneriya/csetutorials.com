For those who are hearing about Spotify for the first time, Spotify is an online music service offering and it offers instant access to over 16 million licence to songs. Spotify now uses AWS cloud to store the data and share it with their customers.</p><p>Prior to AWS they had some issues. Back then users were often getting errors because Spotify could not keep up with the increased demand for storage every new day and that led to users getting upset and users canceling the subscription.</p><p>The problem Spotify was facing at that time was worse. Their users were present globally and were accessing it from everywhere and they had different latency in their applications. Spotify had a demanding situation where they need to frequently catalogue the songs released yesterday. today and in the future and this was changing every new day and the songs coming in rate was about 20,000 a day.</p><p>Back then they could not keep up with this requirement. Needless to say they were badly looking for a way to solve this problem and that&rsquo;s when they got introduced to AWS. It was a perfect fit and match for their problem.
