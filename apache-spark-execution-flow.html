<a class=text-decoration-none href=/topics/big-data rel=category>Big Data</a></div><div class=post-content><p>Apache Spark is a very powerful tool for handling large amounts of data. To use it effectively, it is important to understand how it works. When you run a Spark job, work is started across a group of computers. If you understand how Spark plans this work and how its different parts communicate, you can write good code and solve problems faster.</p><p>This document breaks down the architecture of a Spark application, from the fundamental concepts to the high-level execution flow in a modern CDE (Cloudera Data Engineering) environment on Kubernetes.</p><h2 id=1-fundamental-concepts>1. Fundamental Concepts</h2><p>To understand Spark, we must first understand how it handles data and work.</p><h3 id=the-distributed-dataset-and-partitions>The Distributed Dataset and Partitions</h3><p>Spark is designed to process datasets that are too large for one machine. To do this, it must divide the large dataset into smaller chunks that can be processed in parallel. Each of these chunks is called a Partition.</p><p>A partition is simply a collection of rows from the original dataset. When Spark reads a large file, it determines how to split it into multiple partitions. For example, by default, Spark often creates one partition for every 128 MB block of the file in the underlying storage system. The key idea is that a partition is the smallest piece of the dataset that a single Spark task will work on.</p><h3 id=the-task>The Task</h3><p>A Task is the smallest unit of execution in Spark. It is a single command sent from the Spark Driver to an Executor. This command contains two key components:</p><ol><li>One specific Partition of data that the task is assigned to process.</li><li>A sequence of computations (your code) that the task must apply to every record within that partition.</li></ol><p>This relationship is fundamental: to process the data in parallel, Spark creates one task for every partition.</p><h2 id=2-spark-application-architecture>2. Spark Application Architecture</h2><p>A Spark application is composed of a few key processes that work together.</p><h3 id=spark-driver-the-master-process>Spark Driver (The Master Process)</h3><p>The Driver is the central coordinator and the &ldquo;brain&rdquo; of a Spark application. It is the process where your main() function runs. Its responsibilities are:</p><ul><li>To analyze the user&rsquo;s code.</li><li>To create an optimized execution plan, known as a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).</li><li>To break the DAG into a sequence of Stages.</li><li>To break each Stage into individual Tasks.</li><li>To request resources for workers from the Cluster Manager.</li><li>To schedule and send tasks to the workers (Executors).</li><li>To track the status of all tasks and collect the final result of the job.</li></ul><h3 id=spark-executor-the-worker-process>Spark Executor (The Worker Process)</h3><p>An Executor is a process launched on a machine in the cluster. Its sole purpose is to execute the tasks assigned to it by the Driver.</p><ul><li>Each Executor has a fixed allocation of CPU cores and memory.</li><li>It runs the computations on its assigned data partition and stores any intermediate or final results.</li></ul><p>It is important to note that the Executor itself is the JVM process. A Task is not a separate process; it is a thread of execution that runs inside the Executor&rsquo;s JVM. This allows a single Executor to run multiple tasks concurrently, one on each of its allocated CPU cores.</p><h3 id=cluster-manager-the-resource-manager>Cluster Manager (The Resource Manager)</h3><p>Spark does not manage the cluster hardware itself. It relies on a Cluster Manager to request and release resources for its Executors. In the context of CDE, the Cluster Manager is Kubernetes.</p><h2 id=3-the-complete-execution-flow>3. The Complete Execution Flow</h2><p>The following steps describe the end-to-end process of a Spark job, from submission to completion.</p><ol><li><strong>Job Submission:</strong> The process begins when you call an action (e.g., <code>.count()</code>, <code>.</code>save()`) in your code. This action triggers the creation of a <strong>Job</strong>.</li><li><strong>DAG Creation:</strong> The Spark Driver receives the job request. It analyzes your code&rsquo;s sequence of transformations (like .map and .filter) and builds a <strong>DAG</strong> (Directed Acyclic Graph). The DAG is an optimized blueprint of all the operations that need to be performed.</li><li><strong>Creating Stages:</strong> The Driver divides the job plan into <strong>Stages</strong>. A stage is a group of tasks that can be run in parallel. The key idea is this:<ul><li>When you ask Spark to do simple operations like <code>.map()</code> or <code>.filter()</code>, each Executor can perform the work on its own data partition without needing to communicate with other executors. All of these independent operations can be grouped together into a single stage.</li><li>However, when you ask Spark to do an operation like <code>.groupByKey()</code>, the situation changes. Each executor might have data for the same key. To group all the data for a specific key together, the executors must exchange data with each other. This physical reorganization and movement of data across the network is called a <strong>Shuffle</strong>.</li><li>A shuffle marks the end of one stage. A new stage can only begin after the shuffle is complete and the data is correctly redistributed, so each executor has the data it needs for the next set of operations (e.g., calculating a sum for each key).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Planning the First Stage:</strong> The Driver looks at the first stage. It identifies the input dataset and determines how many <strong>Partitions</strong> it should be divided into.</li><li><strong>Creating Tasks:</strong> The Driver then creates one <strong>Task</strong> for each partition of the input data. This one-to-one mapping is fundamental: 1 partition = 1 task.</li><li><strong>Requesting Executors:</strong> The Driver communicates with the Cluster Manager (Kubernetes in CDE) to request resources for Executors. You can either specify a fixed number of executors, or let Spark adjust the number automatically.<ul><li><strong>Fixed Number:</strong> You can manually set a property like <code>spark.executor.instances</code> to a specific number.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Allocation (Default):</strong> If you do not set a fixed number, Spark will automatically request more executors if it sees that tasks are waiting, and it will release executors if they are idle to save resources.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Task Execution (Stage 1):</strong> The Driver sends the tasks for the first stage to the available executors. Each executor runs its assigned tasks on its assigned partitions.</li><li><strong>Shuffle Write:</strong> When the tasks of a stage that precedes a shuffle are complete, each task writes its output data into new partition files on its own executor&rsquo;s local disk. This is the &ldquo;shuffle write&rdquo; phase.</li><li><strong>Starting the Next Stage:</strong> The output files from the previous stage become the input partitions for the next stage. The Driver creates a new set of tasks for this new stage and sends them to the available executors. The same pool of executors is reused.</li><li><strong>Shuffle Read:</strong> The tasks for the new stage begin by fetching the required data files from the other executors across the network. This is the &ldquo;shuffle read&rdquo; phase.</li><li><strong>Job Completion:</strong> This process of executing stages and shuffling data continues until the final stage is complete. The tasks in the final stage send their results back to the Driver. Once the job is finished, the Driver process can exit.</li><li><strong>Cleanup in CDE:</strong> In a CDE/Kubernetes environment, once the Driver process terminates, Kubernetes automatically destroys the Driver pod and all of its associated Executor pods, releasing all cluster resources.</li></ol></div></article></main><script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js defer></script></body></html>
