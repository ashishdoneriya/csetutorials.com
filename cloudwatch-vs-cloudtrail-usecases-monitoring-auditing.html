<a class=text-decoration-none href=/topics/aws rel=category>AWS</a></div><div class=post-content><p>When working with AWS infrastructure, two services play essential roles in monitoring and management: <strong>Amazon CloudWatch</strong> and <strong>AWS CloudTrail</strong>.<br>Although both are essential, they fulfill distinct roles. This guide will explore the differences between CloudWatch and CloudTrail, when to use each, and how they apply to key AWS services like <strong>S3</strong>, <strong>DynamoDB</strong>, <strong>API Gateway</strong>, and <strong>EC2</strong>. We will also delve into <strong>access logs</strong> and <strong>execution logs</strong>, two critical concepts for tracking the performance and functionality of your services.</p><h2 id=what-is-aws-cloudwatch>What is AWS CloudWatch?</h2><p><strong>Amazon CloudWatch</strong> is a monitoring service that helps you track performance and operational health across your AWS infrastructure and applications. It collects <strong>metrics</strong>, <strong>logs</strong>, and <strong>events</strong>, and allows you to set <strong>alarms</strong> based on specific thresholds.</p><p>CloudWatch is particularly useful for monitoring resource usage—such as <strong>CPU utilization</strong>, <strong>memory usage</strong>, and <strong>disk I/O</strong>—as well as detecting <strong>errors</strong> and <strong>performance issues</strong> in AWS services like EC2, Lambda, and API Gateway. With CloudWatch, you can visualize data in dashboards to gain real-time insights into your infrastructure’s health.</p><h2 id=what-is-aws-cloudtrail>What is AWS CloudTrail?</h2><p><strong>AWS CloudTrail</strong> is a service that tracks and logs <strong>API activity</strong> in your AWS account. It records <strong>who</strong> took actions, <strong>what</strong> they did, <strong>when</strong> it happened, and <strong>where</strong> the request came from. CloudTrail is essential for maintaining a record of changes for governance, security audits, and compliance purposes.</p><p>Every time an API call is made to an AWS service, CloudTrail records that action. This makes it a valuable tool for tracking changes, ensuring compliance, and investigating security incidents by providing a detailed history of API calls.</p><h2 id=cloudwatch-vs-cloudtrail-key-differences>CloudWatch vs. CloudTrail: Key Differences</h2><p>CloudWatch and CloudTrail may seem similar because they both log activity, but they serve very different purposes. CloudWatch focuses on <strong>monitoring performance</strong> and <strong>operational metrics</strong>, while CloudTrail focuses on <strong>auditing API activity</strong> and <strong>tracking changes</strong> to your AWS resources.</p><h3 id=cloudwatch>CloudWatch</h3><ul><li>Tracks <strong>performance metrics</strong> like CPU usage, memory, and network traffic.</li><li>Collects and monitors <strong>logs</strong> from AWS services and custom applications.</li><li>Allows you to set <strong>alarms</strong> to detect issues (e.g., when disk space is running low).</li></ul><h3 id=cloudtrail>CloudTrail</h3><ul><li>Tracks <strong>API activity</strong>, logging details of who performed actions, what was done, and when.</li><li>Provides detailed records for <strong>auditing</strong>, <strong>security investigations</strong>, and <strong>compliance</strong>.</li><li>Useful for tracking <strong>configuration changes</strong> to AWS resources.</li></ul><h2 id=when-to-use-cloudwatch-vs-cloudtrail>When to Use CloudWatch vs. CloudTrail</h2><p>You should use <strong>CloudWatch</strong> when you need to monitor the <strong>operational health</strong> of your resources. This includes tracking performance metrics, setting alarms, and monitoring logs. For example, if you need to monitor <strong>CPU usage</strong> on an EC2 instance or <strong>request counts</strong> on an API Gateway, CloudWatch is the tool for the job. It helps you stay on top of <strong>system performance</strong> and quickly address issues as they arise.</p><p>On the other hand, you should use <strong>CloudTrail</strong> when you need to <strong>audit API activity</strong> or investigate <strong>who made changes</strong> to your AWS resources. CloudTrail is ideal for tracking <strong>security events</strong>, ensuring compliance, and creating an <strong>audit trail</strong>. For example, if you want to find out <strong>who deleted an S3 object</strong> or <strong>who changed the configuration</strong> of a DynamoDB table, CloudTrail provides the detailed logs needed to track down this information.</p><h2 id=cloudwatch-logs-access-logs-vs-execution-logs>CloudWatch Logs: Access Logs vs. Execution Logs</h2><p>In <strong>CloudWatch</strong>, logs are critical for gaining visibility into the behavior of your services. Two types of logs often collected for services like <strong>API Gateway</strong> are <strong>access logs</strong> and <strong>execution logs</strong>.</p><h3 id=access-logs>Access Logs</h3><ul><li>These logs capture <strong>high-level information</strong> about who accessed your API or service. They include details such as <strong>IP addresses</strong>, <strong>HTTP methods</strong> (GET, POST, etc.), and <strong>status codes</strong> (e.g., 200 OK or 404 Not Found).</li><li>Access logs help you monitor <strong>traffic patterns</strong> and see if your services are being accessed correctly. They provide a high-level overview of <strong>who</strong> is using your service and whether their requests are being successfully fulfilled.</li></ul><h3 id=execution-logs>Execution Logs</h3><ul><li>Execution logs offer a <strong>deeper level of detail</strong> by capturing the entire flow of requests inside the API or service. They include <strong>request payloads</strong>, <strong>response payloads</strong>, and any <strong>errors</strong> encountered during the processing of the request.</li><li>These logs are essential for <strong>debugging</strong> and <strong>troubleshooting</strong>. They help you understand what went wrong when a request fails and why certain responses are returned.</li><li>For example, if your <strong>API Gateway</strong> encounters an error during a request, execution logs will show the <strong>request payload</strong>, the <strong>internal processing</strong> of that request, and the <strong>error message</strong> returned. This allows you to investigate and resolve issues faster.</li></ul><h2 id=use-cases-for-cloudwatch-and-cloudtrail-across-aws-services>Use Cases for CloudWatch and CloudTrail Across AWS Services</h2><p>Let’s take a look at how CloudWatch and CloudTrail apply to specific AWS services like <strong>S3</strong>, <strong>DynamoDB</strong>, <strong>API Gateway</strong>, and <strong>EC2</strong>.</p><h3 id=amazon-s3>Amazon S3</h3><p><strong>CloudWatch</strong> is used to monitor the <strong>operational metrics</strong> of your S3 buckets, such as the <strong>number of requests</strong> made, the <strong>amount of data transferred</strong>, and the overall <strong>size of the storage</strong>. It’s particularly helpful when you want to keep an eye on how your S3 bucket is performing or set up alarms if the number of errors exceeds a certain threshold. For example, you might want to know if there’s a spike in <strong>4xx or 5xx errors</strong> and get notified automatically.</p><p>On the other hand, <strong>CloudTrail</strong> provides detailed logs of <strong>API activity</strong> in S3. It records actions such as <strong>who accessed</strong> the bucket, <strong>who created or deleted objects</strong>, and <strong>when those actions occurred</strong>. CloudTrail is essential for <strong>auditing API activity</strong> and tracking who made changes to your data, which is particularly useful for compliance and security purposes. If you need to investigate <strong>who deleted a file</strong> from your bucket, CloudTrail will tell you exactly who did it and when.</p><h3 id=amazon-dynamodb>Amazon DynamoDB</h3><p>For <strong>DynamoDB</strong>, <strong>CloudWatch</strong> tracks <strong>performance metrics</strong> such as <strong>read/write capacity usage</strong>, <strong>throttled requests</strong>, and <strong>latency</strong>. This allows you to monitor your DynamoDB tables to ensure they are performing optimally. If your tables are being overused and you risk hitting the provisioned capacity limits, you can set up CloudWatch alarms to notify you when <strong>throttling</strong> occurs.</p><p>Meanwhile, <strong>CloudTrail</strong> tracks <strong>API actions</strong> related to DynamoDB, such as <strong>table creation</strong>, <strong>deletion</strong>, <strong>data modification</strong>, and <strong>read requests</strong>. This is useful for auditing who made changes to your tables and when. For example, if you need to find out who modified a table schema or deleted a specific record, CloudTrail provides the necessary logs.</p><h3 id=api-gateway>API Gateway</h3><p>For <strong>API Gateway</strong>, <strong>CloudWatch</strong> plays a key role in monitoring <strong>request rates</strong>, <strong>latency</strong>, and <strong>error rates</strong>. It also collects both <strong>access logs</strong> and <strong>execution logs</strong>. The <strong>access logs</strong> allow you to see who accessed your API and the <strong>execution logs</strong> provide detailed insights into what happens when your API processes a request, including request and response payloads and any errors.</p><p>In contrast, <strong>CloudTrail</strong> logs changes to the API itself, such as adding new routes, deploying new stages, or deleting APIs. If you want to know who made changes to your API configuration, CloudTrail provides a detailed history of those actions.</p><h3 id=ec2-instances>EC2 Instances</h3><p><strong>CloudWatch</strong> monitors <strong>EC2 performance metrics</strong> such as <strong>CPU usage</strong>, <strong>memory usage</strong>, <strong>disk I/O</strong>, and <strong>network traffic</strong>. You can also collect <strong>system logs</strong>, <strong>application logs</strong>, and <strong>security logs</strong> from EC2 instances using CloudWatch, but this requires some manual setup. To collect these logs, you need to install and configure the <strong>CloudWatch Agent</strong> on your EC2 instances, which allows you to capture logs beyond the basic metrics.</p><p><strong>CloudTrail</strong>, on the other hand, logs <strong>API activity</strong> related to EC2, such as starting, stopping, or terminating instances, as well as modifying security groups. If you need to track <strong>who launched or terminated an instance</strong> or <strong>who made changes to the security group settings</strong>, CloudTrail is the tool for the job.</p><h3 id=manual-setup-for-cloudwatch-on-ec2>Manual Setup for CloudWatch on EC2</h3><p>While <strong>basic EC2 metrics</strong> such as CPU and network usage are automatically available in CloudWatch, <strong>log collection</strong> from the operating system or applications requires <strong>manual configuration</strong>. You’ll need to install the <strong>CloudWatch Agent</strong> on your EC2 instances and configure it to send logs (such as system logs or application logs) to <strong>CloudWatch Logs</strong>. This manual setup enables detailed logging beyond the default performance metrics.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>In summary, both <strong>CloudWatch</strong> and <strong>CloudTrail</strong> are essential tools for managing your AWS environment, but they serve different purposes. <strong>CloudWatch</strong> focuses on monitoring <strong>performance metrics</strong> and <strong>operational health</strong>, helping you track resource utilization, detect issues, and set alarms. <strong>CloudTrail</strong>, on the other hand, is crucial for <strong>auditing API activity</strong> and tracking <strong>who made changes</strong> to your AWS resources, making it invaluable for security and compliance.</p><p>By combining <strong>CloudWatch</strong> for performance monitoring and <strong>CloudTrail</strong> for auditing, you can maintain a robust and well-monitored AWS environment. Whether you’re tracking CPU usage in EC2, monitoring request rates in API Gateway, or investigating who modified data in DynamoDB</p></div></article></main><script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js defer></script></body></html>
